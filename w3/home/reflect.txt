Quiz 2 reflection

1 (1) A member function can be a query or a modifier. Which c++ keyword identifies is as a query?
	const

3 (3) 

#include <iostream>
class OOP244{
	int noStudents;
public:
	void set(int n) { noStudents = n; }
	void display(){ std::cout << noStudents << std::endl; }
};

int main(){
	OOP244 sectionAB;
	sectionAB.set(79);
	sectionAB.display();                 //(sectionAB… was missing)
} 

	Homework reflection:

1)	How many elements are there in each C-style character string that stores a family or given name for the account? Why? 

In each family of given name there are 41 characters. One extra character is required for null byte '\0', which represents 
the end of line/array and is required for each array of characters. 

2)	Your class declares two member functions named set(...). In C, this would generate an error. Name the feature of C++ that allows this. 

The feature in c++ that allows to have 2 member function with different parameters order, name or parameter type is called overloading

3)	What have you learned during this workshop? 

During this workshop I have learned about distinguishing  types such as "private" and "public" in class, learned how to get 
access to the object through their member functions. I have learned basics of  standard library known as "cstring".
