Quiz reflection 7:
3. (1) C++ implements polymorphic objects using pointer syntax
5. (1) Declare a pure virtual function called foo that receives an int and returns an int:
virtual int foo(int) = 0;
Workshop reflection:
1. What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?
Abstract base class is a class which contains or inherits pure virtual function. 
Concrete class (derived class) contains an implementation of declared functions.
2. Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?
bool credit(double); 
bool debit(double);
Both function have a default implementation in Account class. 
In the same time, ChequingAccount implement its own version. 
As a result, ChequingAccount credit and debit functions shadow the same
Account's functions.
3. Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
In this workshop I have learned how to create abstract base class, 
define pure virtual function, implement virtual function. 
Also, I have learned how to distinguish abstract and concrete classes.
